# Steps:
1. Create a login_info.secret file that contained login_username and login_password. The format will be like *1.
2. Before you run this file, you need to specify the block users list in line 104 first.
3. Run this python file. And it will output a file named "followers.csv". Please input the label in the "class" column. <span style="color:red"> If you already have this csv  you need to turn generate_csv to False(in line 96) to prevent overwrite it.</span>
4. After you done input the class, you can type "ok" in the program.
5. As long as you typed "ok" and run the program, it will block the list you input in the first step, and unblock the else users.
